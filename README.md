Build a Large Language Model From Scratch Overview : 

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) based on the GPT-2 architecture. The project demonstrates the process of building a transformer-based model from scratch, loading pre-trained weights, and generating text using causal language modeling techniques. It is heavily inspired by Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" and Vizuara's YouTube playlist, which provide comprehensive guidance on understanding and implementing LLMs.

Key Features
Full implementation of GPT-2 architecture.

Pre-trained weight loading for text generation tasks.

Customizable sampling parameters for coherent text generation.

Modular design for easy experimentation and extension.

Resources
This project draws inspiration from the following resources:

Book: Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka

The book provides step-by-step guidance on creating LLMs, including coding attention mechanisms, pretraining, fine-tuning, and instruction optimization.
